## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

    <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
      The system has recently transitioned from a Zapier-dependent architecture to a direct event-driven model. This shift centralises state management within [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) workflows, eliminates external dependencies for core logic, and enables direct communication between capture sources (Google Forms/Apps Script) and the Next.js backend.

    <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
        1. Install the Control Tower Onboard CLI: `bun i -g mint` 2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`

- **Zero-Middleware Architecture**: Direct ingestion of webhooks from Google Apps Script, removing Zapier entirely to reduce latency and costs.
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Complex business logic (onboarding, verification, signing) is orchestrated via Inngest, with clear domain events like `onboarding/lead.created` and `contract/signed`.
- **Deterministic Verification**: Replaces probabilistic AI voting with a strict, hierarchical veto system using a local blocklist (`mock_blacklist.json`).
- **Direct Lead Capture**: Secure HTTP endpoints (`/api/webhooks/lead-capture`) handle form submissions directly.
- **Real-time Dashboard**: A comprehens
