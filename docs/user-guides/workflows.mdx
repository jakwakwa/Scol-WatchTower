## Workflow list

Open **Workflows** from the sidebar to see all active and completed workflows.

### What you can do

- Sort by client, status, agent, or start time
- View a workflow’s detail page
- Open the workflow payload for deeper inspection
- Approve or reject workflows awaiting human input

## Workflow stages

Each workflow moves through six stages:

1. **Initiation**: applicant intake and facility application dispatch
2. **Facility, Pre-Risk & Quote**: facility form, sales evaluation, optional pre-risk clearance, and quotation flow
3. **Procurement & AI Verification**: FICA upload, ITC check, sanctions screening, procurement review, and AI analysis
4. **Risk Review**: mandatory Risk Manager review
5. **Contract**: contract draft review plus contract/ABSA collection
6. **Final Approval**: dual approval from Risk Manager and Account Manager

Sanctions screening always runs either during pre-risk (when sales flags issues) or at the main ITC checkpoint after FICA. Results are reused for up to 7 days.

## Workflow statuses

Status badges appear in the list and on each workflow:

- **Pending**: queued and not yet started
- **In progress**: actively processing
- **Awaiting human**: waiting for an approval or manual decision
- **Completed**: all stages finished successfully
- **Failed**: processing ended with an error
- **Timeout**: waiting for input exceeded the time limit
- **Paused**: stopped pending intervention

## Human-in-the-loop actions

When a workflow status is **Awaiting human**, quick actions appear:

- **Approve**: move the workflow to the next stage
- **Reject**: stop the workflow and record a decision

You will be prompted to confirm the action before it is sent.

## Workflow details page

Select **View workflow** from the actions menu to open the detail view.

### Key sections

- **Header**: workflow ID, client, status, and stage
- **Generated quote**: amount, status, and rationale (when available)
- **Activity timeline**: audit log of all events and transitions
- **Client details**: company and contact information
- **Processing status**: current agent and any error details

## Payload viewer

Use **View payload** to open the raw workflow payload. This is useful for:

- Debugging unexpected behaviour
- Verifying data passed between stages
- Supporting escalation and compliance reviews
