## What the Control Tower is for

The Control Tower is your operational hub. It helps you:

- Monitor active onboarding workflows and their stages
- See real-time activity across applicants and workflows
- Respond to alerts and human-in-the-loop approvals
- Track agent performance and workflow health

## Main navigation

Use the left sidebar to move between sections:

- **Overview**: dashboard summary, active workflows, recent activity
- **Applicants**: manage applicants and start onboarding
- **Workflows**: track all workflows, take action, and view details
- **Risk Review**: review AI risk assessments and make structured override decisions
- **Agents**: monitor your external agent fleet

## Dashboard sections at a glance

The overview page is split into a summary grid and live activity.

### Summary cards

You will see cards for:

- **Active Workflows**: number of workflows currently running
- **Pending Approvals**: workflows awaiting human input
- **Total Applicants**: count of all applicants in the system
- **Completion Rate**: a high-level success indicator (if configured)

### Active Workflows table

The table shows key workflow details:

- **Client** and workflow ID
- **Stage** (1–6) with a progress indicator
- **Status** (pending, in progress, awaiting human, completed, failed, timeout, paused)
- **Current Agent** processing the workflow
- **Started** time for the workflow

Use sorting on the table headers to prioritise urgent work.

### Recent Activity feed

This feed lists the latest workflow events, including:

- Stage changes
- Agent dispatches and callbacks
- Human overrides
- Errors and timeouts

## Workflow stages

The onboarding process follows a 6-stage path:

1. **Applicant Capture**: record basic client details and start the workflow
2. **Quotation**: sales evaluation, pre-risk checks, AI quote generation, and client approval
3. **Verification**: complete bank assessment and FICA document checks
4. **Integration**: handover and operational readiness
5. **Contract**: StratCol agreement and call centre application with client approval
6. **Final Approval**: two-factor sign-off by Risk Manager and Account Manager

## AI feedback pipeline

Human override decisions on risk assessments are captured as structured data and fed into an AI retraining pipeline. When a reviewer's decision diverges from the AI recommendation, the system flags the divergence with a category, weight, and type. This enables prioritised model retraining.

For details, see [AI feedback pipeline](/user-guides/ai-feedback-pipeline).

## Notifications

Notifications appear in the top bar and alert you to:

- Items awaiting approval
- Timeouts or errors that require action
- Completed stages or workflows

For step-by-step instructions, see `User guides > Notifications`.
