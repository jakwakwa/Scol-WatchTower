## Forms hub

Each workflow has a dedicated forms hub that shows required forms and progress.

You will see:

- **Form status** for each document
- **Progress** (step count and completion percentage)
- **Stage** where the form belongs

If you do not have a direct link, ask your administrator for the workflow’s forms hub URL.

## Form statuses

- **Not started**: form has not been opened
- **In progress**: draft saved, not submitted
- **Submitted**: sent for review
- **Approved**: accepted, no further action
- **Rejected**: not accepted, requires corrections
- **Revision required**: changes needed before approval

## Working through a form

All forms use a step-by-step wizard:

1. Complete the current step
2. Select **Next** to continue
3. Use **Save draft** to store progress without submitting
4. Select **Submit** at the final step

Required fields are marked with an asterisk.

## Decision-enabled forms

Some forms support an **approve/decline** decision after submission. These forms let the applicant (or client) explicitly accept or reject a step in the onboarding workflow.

### Which forms support decisions

| Form type | Decision labels |
| :--- | :--- |
| Signed Quotation | Approve quotation / Decline quotation |
| StratCol Contract | Approve contract / Decline contract |
| Call Centre Application | Approve call centre application / Decline call centre application |

### How it works

1. The applicant completes and submits the form fields.
2. After submission, **Approve** and **Decline** buttons appear.
3. Declining requires a reason (free text).
4. The decision is recorded via `POST /api/forms/[token]/decision`.
5. Once responded, the form shows a confirmation message and cannot be changed.

### Already-submitted forms

If a form was previously submitted but no decision was recorded, the applicant sees the approve/decline buttons without the form fields. This handles the case where the form data was submitted in one session and the decision is made in another.

### Status tracking

Form instances track decision status with these fields:

- **decisionStatus**: `pending` or `responded`
- **decisionOutcome**: `approved` or `declined`
- **decisionReason**: free text (populated on decline)
- **decisionAt**: timestamp of the response

### Workflow impact

When a client declines a decision-enabled form:

- The workflow receives a termination event.
- The applicant receives a confirmation email.
- The decline reason is stored on the workflow record.
- The workflow terminates with the appropriate reason.

See [Workflows → Applicant approve/decline flow](/user-guides/workflows#applicant-approvedecline-flow) for how decisions affect workflow progression.

## Signature capture

When a signature is required:

- Sign directly in the canvas area with a mouse or touch
- Use **Clear** to reset the canvas
- Select **Confirm signature** to save it

Signatures are stored with timestamp and audit data.
